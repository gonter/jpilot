==============================================================================

These are some of the known bugs:

* Priority High:

* Priority Medium:

 - print system is not i18n compliant

* Priority Low:

 - Kyocera QCP 6035 phone/palm combos don't close the address database, so it
   can't be sync'ed.  It is a Kyocera problem, and there is no known solution.

 - Setting the time on Palm OS 3.3 in a conduit will crash the handheld.
   SyncTime will detect OS 3.3 and do nothing.  The fix is to upgrade Palm OS.

* Priority Who Cares?:

* Quirks (not really bugs):

 - jpilot lets you enter in blank todo's, etc.  The palm pilot will not allow
   this.

 - The palm pilot will only let you make appointments on 5 minute intervals.
   jpilot will allow 1 minute intervals.

 - The PalmOS datebook will alarm on private records even when they are hidden
   and they show up on the screen.  Right, or wrong, who knows.
   Jpilot will do the same.

* Palm OS bugs that have been found while creating J-Pilot

 - If you try to sync with a pilotrate of 0 then the palm pilot will get a
   fatal exception and reboot.  (tested on 3.1) This is a PalmOS bug.

 - The Palm pilot will let you sync (add) an appointment that repeats weekly,
   but doesn't repeat on any day.  It won't show up in the calendar, but if
   you search for it, it shows up.  When you click on it in find, a Fatal
   Exception occurs and the Pilot reboots.  This is a PalmOS bug if you ask me.

 - Empty appointments crash Palm OS 2.0 (Jpilot doesn't allow them anymore)
